When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you want to collaborate on a project with someone.
When you want to have a backup of your files on a server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because someone else might have added something to your project that you do not
want to add to your local repository.
You might not always have an internet connection so having Git might run into
errors if it tries to pull changes without an internet connection.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks: clones of repositories on Github to your profile.
Clones: local copies of a repository (can either come from a remote or another
local repository)
Branches: a label for your commits. Any branches you create are separate from
your master branch.
You would use a Fork when you want to copy someone else's repo to your profile,
a clone when you want to make a clone of a remote repo to your hard drive and a
branch when you want to test out a new feature without affecting the main branch
